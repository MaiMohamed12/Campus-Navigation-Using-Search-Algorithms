# Campus Navigation Using Search Algorithms

## Overview
This project models **Zewail City Campus navigation** as a grid-based search problem.  
It applies fundamental **AI search algorithms** to find optimal paths between buildings while considering obstacles and campus layout constraints.

## Description
The notebook defines a formal problem-solving structure using the **Problemâ€“Node** model from Artificial Intelligence.  
A customized `ZC_Map` class represents the campus as a grid, where each cell corresponds to a real location on the map.  
Search algorithms such as **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**, and **A\*** are applied to explore possible routes and determine the most efficient path.

Visualization functions display the grid and the computed route, providing an intuitive understanding of how each algorithm performs in spatial navigation tasks.
