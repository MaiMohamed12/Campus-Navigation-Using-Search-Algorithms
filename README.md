# Campus-Navigation-Using-Search-Algorithms
This project models the Zewail City campus as a grid-based environment to simulate intelligent navigation using classic AI search algorithms. It defines a formal problem-solving structure, applies BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* to find optimal routes between buildings, and visualizes the resulting paths for analysis and comparison.
